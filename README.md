# RSLibreCell - a FreeCell implementation

Copyright Â© 2025 and later: tristhaus

## For Users

The implementation is terminal-based and has a text interface, which is resizable and zoomable in modern terminals. Check the Help window for a listing of active keys. More features, such as the *journey* mode of [CSLibreCell](https://github.com/tristhaus/CSLibreCell) are planned.
